## Description

The App allows the users to type in the ingredients they have in their fridge. 
It then provides a suggestion about recipes that they can make with the available ingredients. 
For example, if a user types in Spaghetti, prawns, red peppers, onions, it will produce a dish of ‘pasta with shrimp and Bell peppers or  Roasted Red Peppers and Herbs.  
The App also enables users to type in the name a dish. This will then produce full ingredients of the dish along with its calories contents.

To access the finished application please use the following link: [Foodify App]().

To view the code repository for the deployed application please use the following link: [Github Repository](https://github.com/FireCodexs/Foodify).

## Wireframing

Project wireframe containing the rough outline of the three main elements of the web application design including :

*section 1) the homepage - what the user will first see when they view the application via the deployed link

*section 2) the result page - what the user will see when they click the search page

*section 3) what the user will see when they request further details on their search results.

This wireframe is not the defined end result but a guide for all authors to create the initial structure of the app from which it shall evolve.

*[Wireframe 1](https://github.com/FireCodexs/Foodify/blob/65bd4dfcc95284ade306576fb401580f4638ede9/assets/images/wireframe%201.png)
## Usage

To use the app the user will need to access the link for the deployed application shown under [Links](#links).

Once they load the application they will see a homepage that they can navigate through using the navigation bar.

Clicking the recipe cards button will take a user to the bottom of the page and if they have carried out a search they will see the dishes cards displayed there.

Clicking the about the application button will take the user to the page section that explains how the application works.

Clicking Jokes for Health will take a user to the jokes section of the website. (Here they can click the "Click for another Joke" button to see more jokes if they like) (the jokes are sourced using the ninja joke api.)

Clicking the search history button will display the users search history in a modal if there is a search history(the search history will persist regardless of a page reload unless the user clicks the accompanying clear history button).

The user can use the input box to input the name of a food item in their pantry and press search.
If the item is correctly spelt and known to the api it will return a series of cards (maximum 5 towards the bottom of the page ) that display a range of healthy dishes that the user may use if they wish. 

the user may carry out multiple searches and their searches are stored under the search history button.

once the user sees the recipe cards they may click on the calorie button to show a modal that displays the calorie content of the dish allowing the user to make a informed decision over the healthiness of the dish.

the user can click the home button at the bottom of the page to return to the top if they wish.
